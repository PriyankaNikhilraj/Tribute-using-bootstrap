            </h1>
            <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam (/ˈɑːbdəl kəˈlɑːm/ (About this sound listen); 15 October
                1931 – 27 July 2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the 11th
                president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and
                studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and
                science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and
                Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space
                programme and military missile development efforts.[1] He thus came to be known as the Missile
                Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.
                [2][3][4] He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's
                Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.<br><br>
